The core is a group of muscles that stabilizes and controls the pelvis and spine (and therefore influences the legs and upper body). 
Core strength is less about power and more about the subtleties of being able to maintain the body in ideal postures â€” to unload the joints and promote ease of movement. 

For the average person, this helps them maintain the ability to get on and off the floor to play with their children or grandchildren, stand up from a chair, sit comfortably at a desk, or vacuum and rake without pain. 
For athletes, it promotes more efficient movement, therefore preventing injury and improving performance. 

Having a strong or stable core can often prevent overuse injuries, and can help boost resiliency and ease of rehab from acute injury. 
The core also includes the pelvic floor musculature, and maintaining core stability can help treat and prevent certain types of incontinence.
